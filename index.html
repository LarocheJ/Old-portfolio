              <h3>Providing potential interns with an awesome opportunity</h3>
              <p>
                I created this one page website for the same company that had me
                create <a href="#ynb">Yournextbest</a>. They have many projects
                going on and need some help achieving their goals. Therefore,
                they had me come up with a website where potential interns could
                go to, get some information about open internships and apply
                online.
              </p>
              <p>
                I used
                <a href="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank" title="Clicking this will open another tab">Weblfow</a>
                for this project. It is a growing CMS and I wanted to learn it
                and add it on my skills toolbelt to give clients another option.
                Normally, I would have created this from scratch, but because
                the client wanted to be able to edit and customize the
                internships themselves, and because I had a tight deadline, I
                decided to use Webflow to give them the freedom to edit the
                website as they needed easily.

              <h3>Adding value to kids going through school</h3>
              <p>
                The client I built this website for is a motivational speaker.
                He goes to junior and high schools and gives teenagers
                motivational talks. These talks are very impactful, however, he
                felt like he needed to do more. So, him and his team came up
                with an idea. The general idea was to shoot videos and upload
                them on a platform where those kids could go and watch when they
                needed to be inspired. They decided a website would be a great
                idea. Luckily, I know one of the guys on his team and he ran the
                idea through me. After spending a good chunk of a summer on the
                project, what you see here is what we came up with.
              </p>
              <p>
                The website features 10 videos that a user can access after
                signing up and logging in. After each video, the user is
                presented with a few questions, which they must answer before
                being able to view the next video. All this information gets
                uploaded to a MySQL database. I created an admin interface and
                provided an access for the client and his team so that they can
                keep track of these answers and find ways to better help their
                audience.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was a very fun project where I learned a lot in terms of
                creating a website from scratch as well as client interaction.

              <h3>A mock e-commerce website</h3>
              <p>
                I created this website in school, at the end of the second
                semester. The goal was to create our very own e-commerce
                website. It didn’t need to be a full-fledged website, but the
                main components of an e-commerce website had to be present. We
                were given a logo and strict brand guidelines that were less
                than beautiful, which was intentional and part of the challenge.
              </p>
              <p>
                We had to provide a way to filter at least 20 different items by
                category and sort the results alphabetically or by price. A user
                needed to be able to add items to their cart, see their total
                and check out. The order would then go into a MySQL database.
              </p>
              <p>
                This was a fun project and I am happy with the final product. It
                was a challenge creating something from scratch that not only
                looked good with the given brand guidelines, but also provided
                good functionality.

              <h3>E-learning project</h3>
              <p>
                This website was created in school. The goal was to create an
                e-learning platform. I was responsible for the majority of the
                backend side of the website development as well as some of the
                front-end and content for the modules while my classmates
                provided the media elements and some of the content.
              </p>
              <p>
                The biggest challenge while developing this project was to come
                up with a way to create a clear system of progression where a
                user could log out, come back later and continue where they left
                off. We wanted to create a system where each user would have
                their own account. For that reason, we created a secure signup
                and login form.
              </p>
              <p>
                New users would have their information entered into a database
                upon completion of the form and returning users would be
                authenticated by taking the entered password and comparing it
                with the encrypted one in our database. Then, a user could go on
                to continue or begin our e-learning course.

              <h3>Personal Blog Experiment</h3>
              <p>
                Without solid
                <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>, a website
                simply will not perform. While it is not my focus, I felt that
                my SEO skills were somewhat lacking and wanted to learn more
                about it and improve the performance of future client’s websites
                on search engines.
              </p>
              <p>
                Not only do I want to further my SEO skills, I have always been
                interested in Affiliate marketing but knew very little about
                that world. For this reason, I decided to launch a blog where I
                could not only work on my writing, but also sharpen my SEO and
                Affiliate Marketing skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, in July 2019, I launched a simple blog targeting the web
                development niche called “Relatacode”. I kept the design side of
                things very simple and focused on the content. While the website
                isn’t all that popular yet, I gained invaluable knowledge about
                SEO and Affiliate Marketing, which was the main goal. I have put
                this project on hold for now as I focus on other aspects of web
                development, but I do plan on coming back to it in the near
                future.

                Taking potential students through an NMPD Space Adventure
              </h3>
              <p>
                This was a group school project where students were tasked with
                coming up with an original concept designed to inform potential
                future students about the
                <abbr title="New Media Production & Design">NMPD</abbr>
                program. For this project, I was the frontend developer.
              </p>
              <p>
                The team and I came up with a space concept where we take
                students on a space-themed adventure. Clicking on the rocket
                brings up a video that we made featuring an introduction to the
                program where each planet is a class and the planets were
                designed to resemble the teachers from each class.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was a fun challenge to come up with a unique concept that
                would cover the entire program and keep it as simple as
                possible. We kept the design minimalistic and stuck to SAIT
                brand guidelines. Furthermore, we made the website responsive to
                accommodate the vast majority of people that browse the web on
                their phone nowadays.

                I’m a recent graduate from the
                <abbr title="Southern Alberta Institute of Technology">SAIT</abbr>
                New Media Production & Design program. If you’re not familiar
                with it, I basically learned how to make good looking websites
                using up-to-date design trends and semantically valid code. In
                the program, I learned how to become proficient with the Adobe
                Suite and leverage it to be very time-efficient while working
                on projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm a big fan of the
                <abbr title="Keep It Simple Stupid">K.I.S.S</abbr>
                principle. It's the foundation of all my work. I strive for a
                beautiful, yet simple interface where users will not pull out
                their hair while trying to navigate the websites I create for
                them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The tools I'm pretty solid with include:

                I love to learn and every day I look forward to trying
                something new. I am constantly pushing the boundaries of what
                I know. I do this by playing with new technologies and going
                through courses on
