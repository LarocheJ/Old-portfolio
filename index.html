              I am a web designer currently based in Calgary, Alberta and
              available for work. I specialize on the front-end

            <div class="col-2">
              <h2>Intern 52</h2>
              <h3>Client Project</h3>
              <p>Intern52 is a sister website for the not for profit organization I currently do freelance work for: <a
                  href="https://access52.com" target="_blank">Access52</a>. Intern52 is a platform where the employer
                can add internship opportunities and a place where candidates can go to apply to work with Access52.</p>
              <h4>The Challenge</h4>
              <p>Access52 needed a standalone website where they could post job and internship opportunities. The
                website had to be very easy to use and to the point. Furthermore, the client needed to be able to manage
                the website’s content themselves easily.</p>
              <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>Using <a href="https://webflow.com" target="_blank">Webflow</a>, I was able to create a one-page
                website where candidates can easily browse and apply for internships. Additionally, because I ensured to
                use Webflow’s dynamic tools, the employer can easily add, remove and edit positions without needing to
                hire another web developer</p>

              <h2>Yournextbest</h2>
              <h3>Client Project</h3>
              <p>Yournextbest is a follow-up program where students, parents and teachers can go after a motivational
                talk to get inspired, challenged and impacted through a series of powerful videos. </p>
              <h4>The Challenge</h4>
              <p>Students, parent and teachers come from all kinds of different backgrounds. Not only did I have to
                ensure the platform was easily accessible via mobile, tablet and desktop, but also ensure that the
                visitors didn’t get lost or confused using the website.</p>
              <p>The client also required an area where they could view their users and track the data. </p>
              <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>The solution was to create a responsive website where visitors could securely sign up and login,
                enabling them to access their profile page, where they could access a series of impactful videos.</p>
              <p>There are 2 items in the navigation: login and signup. This ensured that visitors didn’t get lost with
                overwhelming content and allowed them to access the videos as quickly and as easily as possible.</p>
              <p>Regarding the client, I created an admin dashboard page where they could view all their user’s
                information and dynamically add data to the website.</p>

              <h3>Individual Academic Project </h3>
              <h4>The Challenge</h4>
              <p>A company’s brand guidelines are sacred, and it is important to stick to them, no matter how much a
                designer might disagree with them. This academic project is exactly what it was meant to simulate. I had
                to create an e-commerce website using very bright colours such as purple and orange, as well as a logo
                that is less than pretty, and make it work.</p>
              <p>The website didn’t need to be a full-fledged e-commerce website, however, basic functionality such as
                adding to cart, filtering, sorting and checking out had to be present.</p>
              <p>Finally, all the product photography had to be done by myself. </p>
              <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>I decided to be bold and embrace the vibrant colour scheme that was available to me. I used existing
                bakery e-commerce websites for inspiration and ended up with a unique looking website that I was happy
                with, considering it was my first large scale website development project.</p>

              <h2>First Time Muay Thai</h2>
              <h3>Group Academic Project</h3>
              <h4>The Challenge</h4>
              <p>To create an e-learning platform where users of varying backgrounds could go to learn the basics of the
                combat sport of Muay Thai. </p>
              <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>Our solution was to keep everything as streamlined and as simple as humanly possible. We created a very
                simple home page featuring some history about the sport and a mock contact form.</p>
              <p>Our navigation consisted of a logo and a login button. The login button prompted the user to provide
                their login details, or to signup if they didn’t already have an account.</p>
              <p>Once logged in, they had access to their dashboard. This is where they could see their progression and
                access the various chapters. In order to unlock a chapter, they had to go through the previous one, and
                complete a simple quiz. Once a user had completed all the modules, they were rewarded with a certificate
                with their name on it, which they could then print.</p>
              <p>It was quite challenging to get the progression system working the way we wanted it to. However, with a
                lot of hard work and persistence, we managed to get it working exactly the way we wanted to using PHP.
              </p>
              <h4>My Role</h4>
              <p>For this project, I was mainly in charge of the backend website development, the progression system
                logic and most of the frontend design.</p>

              <h2>Shangri-La</h2>
              <h3>Individual Academic Project</h3>
              <h4>The Challenge</h4>
              <p>To create a WordPress theme from scratch about a fictional resort called “Shangri-la.” </p>
              <p>I had to take the content from an existing website that our instructors made, and completely re-design
                it using modern design trends. The website had to include a live weather report from the OpenWeather
                API, as well as several pins on a map showing popular attractions on the island using the Google Maps
                API.</p>
              <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>After researching existing resorts for inspiration, I was able to create a more modern look using an
                inviting hero image, a simple navigation and a responsive design.</p>
              <p>Using the WordPress Codex, I was able to achieve all the necessary functionality, such as the search,
                sorting, dynamically retrieving posts and displaying the date it was written, creating a custom front
                page, embedding a Google Font using the “wp_enqueue_script” function, and much more.</p>

              <h2>Space Adventure</h2>
              <h3>Group Academic Project</h3>
              <h4>The Challenge</h4>
              <p>The challenge my group and I had to overcome was to come up with a unique concept that would clearly
                educate future SAIT students on what the <abbr title="New Media Production and Design">NMPD</abbr>
                program was all about.</p>
              <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>Through clever use of videos and visuals, we were able to create a space themed website that was
                different and inviting. Each course was a planet that future students could visit and get information
                on. </p>
              <p>It was a fun challenge to come up with a unique concept that would cover the entire program and keep it
                as simple as possible. We kept the design minimalistic and stuck to SAIT brand guidelines. </p>
              <h4>My Role</h4>
              <p>My main role for this project was to be the frontend developer. Aside from the animated stars on the
                homepage, all the frontend design aspects on the website were coded by me. I also helped with a little
                bit of backend development. </p>

              <h2>Movie Search App</h2>
              <h3>Passion Project</h3>
              <h4>The Challenge</h4>
              <p>To create a simple movie search app using the OMDB API and technologies I had never used before, such
                as: Node.js, Embedded JavaScript Template, Git, SASS and Heroku. I wanted to expose myself to as many
                new technologies as possible in this project.</abbr>
                program. For this project, I was the frontend developer.</p>
              <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>After a great deal of “googling” and struggle, I was able to create an extremely simple app that looks
                like it could have taken 5 minutes to do. However, the point of this project was not to create a
                beautiful and full-fledged website, but to get familiar with new technologies.</p>
              <p>In the end I was able to do just that, and it allowed me to get my foot in the door with languages and
                environments I was previously completely unfamiliar with. </p>

              <h2>YelpCamp Project</h2>
              <h3>Passion Project</h3>
              <h4>The Challenge</h4>
              <p>I have been going through a Udemy course for the past 8 months and the final project was to create a
                fully functional dynamic website. I decided to create a campground website. Users had to be able to sign
                up, login, add campgrounds, add comments, remove and/or edit campgrounds if they added it and browse all
                campgrounds added to the website. All this data had to be stored on a MongoDB database, run on a Node.js
                server and created using
                the Express framework.</p>
              <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>Using what I had learned from the course up to that point, I was able to rise to the challenge and
                create a dynamic campground website. I really enjoyed this project as it allowed me to learn tons on
                creating fully fledged dynamic websites using many new technologies. I learned that there are many
                packages that already exist that can simplify a lot of functionality, such as the passport package for
                authentication. </p>

              <p>
                I’m a recent graduate from the
                <abbr title="Southern Alberta Institute of Technology">SAIT</abbr>
                New Media Production & Design program. If you’re not familiar
                with it, I basically learned how to make good looking websites
                using up-to-date design trends and semantically valid code. In
                the program, I learned how to become proficient with the Adobe
                Suite and leverage it to be very time-efficient while working
                on projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm a big fan of the
                <abbr title="Keep It Simple Stupid">K.I.S.S</abbr>
                principle. It's the foundation of all my work. I strive for a
                beautiful, yet simple interface where users will not pull out
                their hair while trying to navigate the websites I create for
                them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The tools I'm pretty solid with include:

                I love to learn and every day I look forward to trying
                something new. I am constantly pushing the boundaries of what
                I know. I do this by playing with new technologies and going
                through courses on
                <a href="https://www.lynda.com/" target="_blank">Lynda.com</a>

                Right now, I am very interested in the following technologies
